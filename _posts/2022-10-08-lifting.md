If you're a beginner that for some reason or other want to start lifting, the easiest approach is probably just to pick a ready made training program such as [Starting Strength](https://startingstrength.com/get-started) or [Stronglifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) and stick to it. 
But if you're anything like me, you'll be curious about _why_ these programs make sense, and whether they could be optimized for your body, your schedule, your goals or your equipment. 
This blog post is my attempt (as a fellow beginner) to summarize and explain what countless hours on youtube watching "no bs science fit-tubers" such as [Jeff Nippard](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffNippard) and [Jeremy Ethier](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeremyEthier) has taught me about the basics of resistance training. 
My biggest takeaways have been understanding why compound movements are great and how to program with supersets, in order to make workouts as time effective as possible, so I've placed emphasis on those parts. 
However, the goal of this blogpost has been to cover everything needed to get started. 
I hope it brings you joy and gains.

## Compound exercises ü¶µüí™

Compound exercises are exercises that train many muscles at the same time. 
This makes a lot of sense for a beginner, both from an efficiency perspective, and for building functional strength. 
Compound exercises are best achieved with free weights (barbells and dumbbells) since they allow multiple movements and involve many muscles in order to balance the weights and stabilize the body. 
An example of a compound exercise is the [deadlift](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/GluteusMaximus/BBDeadlift), that emphasizes gluteus maximus and hamstrings for the hip bend, but also involves quadriceps for the knee bend, forearms for grip, and calves plus basically every single muscle in your core for balancing and stabilizing. 
The opposite to compound exercises are isolation exercises, such as the [machine leg curl](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Hamstrings/LVSeatedLegCurl), that focus on eliminating technique, balance and other muscles, in order to fatigue the targeted muscle maximally. 

(Almost) all compound exercises place emphasis on one of the following six movements. 
If you want an effective full body workout program, just make sure you're covering all of them. 


| Movement            | Target              | Example |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------|
| Knee bend           | Thighs              | [Squat](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BBSquat) |
| Hip bend            | Butt & lower back   | [Deadlift](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/GluteusMaximus/BBDeadlift) |
| Horizontal push     | Chest & triceps     | [Bench press](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/PectoralSternal/BBBenchPress) |
| Horizontal pull     | Upper back & biceps | [Bent-over row](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/BackGeneral/BBBentOverRow) |
| Vertical push       | Shoulders & triceps | [Overhead press](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidAnterior/BBMilitaryPress) |
| Vertical pull       | Mid back & biceps   | [Pull-ups](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/BWPullup) |

Some comments and disclaimers:

- Abs, lower back and forearms are involved in most heavy compound lifts and don't need to be targeted specifically.
- Calves, neck and side delts are somewhat under-emphasized, which probably isn't a huge deal unless you have a specific aesthetic reason for growing them.

## Programming with compound exercises üóì

There are two philosophies and three classic "splits" for these compound movements.  

The first philosophy is to do full body workouts, where every workout includes at least one leg, one push and one pull movement. 
It allows you to hit all muscle groups many times per week, and maximizes the quality of each exercise (since you can do a "fresh" exercise for each muscle group during each workout). 
This seems to be a great approach for beginners (who can't / shouldn't fully deplete their muscles on every workout) as well as more advanced lifters (who know their body's cues enough to not overtrain). 

The second philosophy is to split the movements based on which muscles are activated, which maximizes for rest time between workouts. 
The two classic splits would be either upper-lower body, or push-pull-legs. 

Make sure to include rest days in your program, especially as the lifts start to get heavy. 
One to three days of workout followed by one day of rest seems common and should work well, especially for a beginner.

## Supersets ‚ö°Ô∏è

This is the end of "common knowledge", and where I get a bit more opinionated and experimental. 
I like to optimize for time efficiency and I grow restless when waiting between sets. 
A study by Paz et al 2017 compared supersetting two antagonistic exercises, bench press and seated rows (one set of bench press followed by one set of seated rows, before resting two minutes and repeating) to regular scheduling of the same exercises (resting two minutes between each set).
The supersetting resulted in increased muscle growth compared to doing exercises with rest (!), while cutting workout time in half (!!), so more than 2x the gains per minute in the gym. 
A similar study has been conducted on exercises targeting the same muscle groups (bench press and incline bench press) showed decreased muscle growth. 
I haven't been able to find a study that investigates the effect on "unrelated" exercises (such as squats and biceps curls). 

Based on this, supersetting push/pull movements with each other is a no-brainer for me. 
And since there is no evidence to the contrary, I superset my leg exercises (knee and hip bend) with unrelated muscle groups (such as abs, calves, or extra arm work). 
As long as I place the leg exercise first in the pairing, my hypothesis is that it barely hurts the first exercise, and the other exercise is "almost free" from a workout duration perspective. 

The problem with supersetting is that it requires more planning or equipment, which could make it tricky to do in a crowded public gym (hogging equipment) or in a home gym (where you might only have one barbell). 
I'd still say it's possible if you get creative or are willing to compromise. 
Overhead press under a pull-up bar. 
Take some extra seconds to move the bench after bench press, place the barbell on the ground, and load some extra plates for the barbell rows. 
Do the second exercise with dumbbells or body weight.
To me it seems worth it.

## Mandatory beginner notes üìù

This is where most people who have been to a gym could probably stop reading, but for completeness I'll briefly mention some other tidbits that I think are necessary to start working out:

- Resistance training is not like cardio, you need proper rest for your reps to count. One (for complete beginners) to three (for really heavy lifts) minutes seems to be well established standards.
- You measure your workouts in sets and reps. Three sets of five reps means that you perform five repetitions of an exercise, then wait two minutes before starting over three times.
- Resistance training is not like cardio, in order for your reps to count you need your sets to be really really difficult. Aim for two reps in reserve (RIR) on most sets, but push yourself all the way to failure (meaning you couldn't complete another _technically correct and safe_ reptition with a gun to your head) on the last set of an exercise every now and then. 
- Rule of thumb (even if it's not 100 % clear if it still holds in recent studies) is to aim for five reps to build maximal strength, and 12 reps to build maximal muscle volume. I currently aim for seven. But don't sweat it, as a beginner you'll grow and become stronger whichever you aim for.
- The way you adjust the difficulty is through picking the weights that allow you to do your target number of reps.
- There's this really important concept called __progressive overloading__. For every week spent in the gym, you _should_ be able to a) lift heavier weights, b) do more reps, or c) do more sets. Challenge your muscles by trying to increase these variables (in this order). If you find yourself unable to do this (this is referred to as _plateauing_), your muscles won't grow and you won't be stronger. Eat more protein, change exercise, or google "deloading". 
- Starting weights aren't super important since your first month with free weights and compound movements are mostly about learning safe technique. 
- For warmup I tend to do a few reps with just the bar, a few reps with about half the goal weight, and then just go for it, with very little rest. I only do this for the first exercise of the workout. But some cardio is probably a good idea as well, and just "dry-running" movements with bodyweight before you do them is helpful from both a warmup and a technique standpoint.
- Weekly volume (number of sets per muscle) seems to be a game of diminishing returns. Any work is a lot better than no work, but aiming for 10-20 sets per muscle seems to be an optimum supported by studies.
- Track your workouts! I'm enjoying the free version of [hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/), but your notes app works as well. This helps progressive overloading.
